# ExponentMathExample

A quick script to show that 0 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 ... ! = 1/12<br/>
Precision is changeable (currently set at 60 decimal places)<br/>
Also a good example of what I like to call precision death.<br/>
It's a simple way to show how computers deal with floating<br/>
point maths and their limitations.
